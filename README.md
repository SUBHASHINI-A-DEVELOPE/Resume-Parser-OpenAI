# Resume-Parser-OpenAI
Developed a Resume Parser leveraging OpenAI's advanced Language Models to efficiently process and extract key details from resumes. The system aims to streamline the recruitment process by automating the extraction of candidate information, reducing manual data entry, and improving the accuracy of resume analysis.
Problem with Traditional ATS Software:
Traditional ATS systems often require manual adjustments for different job domains and industries. This means each ATS setup needs to be customized for various fields, leading to a lot of time and effort spent on configuring and maintaining different parsing rules and keyword sets for each domain. This approach is not only labor-intensive but also prone to inconsistencies and errors.

How AI Improves This::
AI-powered resume parsers automatically adapt to various job domains without needing manual adjustments. They use advanced machine learning algorithms and NLP to understand and extract relevant information from resumes across different industries and job roles. This reduces the need for domain-specific customization, streamlining the process and ensuring more consistent and accurate parsing of resumes.
